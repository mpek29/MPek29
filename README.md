## üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Florian Pasco, a **multiskills systems engineering student** in **electronics, computer science and mechatronics** specializing in **embedded systems**.

üë®‚Äçüíª Here, I intend to propose most of my open-source projects for permise that everyone can enrich themselves with fairly simple and reusable projects in the fields of electronics, computer programming and mechanics.

üö≤ Outside of the world of technology, I like to elevate myself intellectually in various ways. My hobbies range from **cycling**, **repairing old bikes**, **petanque** to other more social like **participate in several associations**.

üìö I am also interested in books or reports on the **French Polar Institute**, **self-training** and **repairing objects**.

‚õ∫ I also really like **travelling** and discovering new things. Both in a close radius on foot and by bike but also on an expedition with my bike and my tent!
