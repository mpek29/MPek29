## üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Florian Pasco, a **master student** in **Engineering (Electronics, Computer Science and Mechatronics)**.

üë®‚Äçüíª Here, I intend to propose most of my open-source projects for permise that everyone can enrich themselves with fairly simple and reusable projects in the fields of electronics, computer programming and mechanics.

üö≤ Outside the world of technology, I like to improve my skills in a variety of ways. My hobbies range from **running** to more social activities such as **participating in various associations**.

üìö I‚Äôm also interested in books and reports from the **French Polar Institute**, **self-training**, **personal development** and **repairing objects**.

‚õ∫ I love to **travel and discover new things**. Both within a short radius, on **foot** and by **bike**, but also on **expeditions in my car**!
